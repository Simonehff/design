                    <p>
                        Plastubos is on the market for ovew 20 years offering low price pipes and connections, having product distribution available in all country. The design project was developed while working at Mint Interactive Lab, with the design team being Simone Hoffmann and Teilor Capanema.

                        Due to a recent brand redesign, Plastubos wanted an coherent digital repositioning. A website update aimed to close the gap between the company and the costumer, offering technical information about it's products to ease the purchasing process.

                        The website main content and goal is to show and detail the technical information about the Plastubos products.

                        The project included the understanding of the user needs through the stakeholder, building a new information architecture, wireframes, a design system based on the new brand identity and a high fidelity layout and prototype both for mobile and desktop platforms.

                        One of the main challenges of the project was to ensure the brand guidelines were being followed while catering to Plastubo's clients, being mainly a male demographic at the early adulthood or older. It was a fine line between too cheerful or not following the brand guidelines.

                        The website was developed focused in the most used resolutions in the country: 1366x768 (21.78%) for desktop devices and 360x640 (17.63%) for mobile devices (Statcounter GlobalStats - 2019).
